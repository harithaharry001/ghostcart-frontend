# Specification Quality Checklist: GhostCart - AP2 Protocol Demonstration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec focuses on user flows and protocol requirements. Implementation details like Python, FastAPI, React are properly relegated to constitution and assumptions.

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: PASS - User stories clearly describe value: immediate purchase flow, autonomous monitoring with pre-authorization, intelligent routing.

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: PASS - Language is accessible. AP2 protocol explanations are necessary external constraints, not implementation details. User scenarios use plain language.

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: PASS - User Scenarios & Testing ✓, Requirements ✓, Success Criteria ✓, Edge Cases ✓, Key Entities ✓

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status**: PASS - Zero clarification markers. All requirements are concrete.

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: PASS - Each FR has clear MUST statements. Examples:
    - FR-004: "System MUST create Intent Mandate capturing user search query for audit trail"
    - FR-019: "System MUST create Cart Mandate with agent signature (NOT user signature) when conditions are met per AP2 human-not-present flow"
    - FR-037: "Payment Agent MUST be extractable to separate folder and usable in different commerce scenarios"

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS - All SC entries have specific metrics:
    - SC-001: "under 90 seconds"
    - SC-005: "at least 10 concurrent monitoring jobs"
    - SC-008: "100% field compliance"
    - SC-009: "100% job persistence"

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: PASS - Success criteria focus on user outcomes and behavior, not technology:
    - "Users can complete flow in under X seconds" (not "API responds in X ms")
    - "System handles X concurrent jobs" (not "Redis cache supports X connections")
    - "Payment Agent can be extracted and reused" (not "Python module can be imported")

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS - Each user story has 5-7 detailed Given-When-Then scenarios covering complete flows.

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 7 edge cases documented:
    - Payment declined
    - Product out of stock (HP flow)
    - Product out of stock (HNP monitoring)
    - Monitoring conditions never met
    - Signature verification fails
    - Agent unclear on intent
    - Server restart during monitoring

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS - Assumptions section clearly defines boundaries:
    - Demo context (hackathon, not production)
    - Target platform (laptop/desktop primary)
    - Authentication (assumed to exist, not detailed)
    - Mock services (no real integrations)
    - Scalability limits (10 concurrent jobs)

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 10 assumptions documented covering demo context, platform, auth, currency, monitoring defaults, product data, network, payment processing, signature simulation, and scalability.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - 66 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-066) all have clear MUST statements defining testable behavior.

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS - Three user stories cover:
    - P1: Human-Present immediate purchase (core MVP)
    - P2: Human-Not-Present autonomous monitoring (key differentiator)
    - P3: Intelligent agent routing (orchestration)

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - 14 success criteria with specific metrics. Acceptance Criteria Summary provides 9 completion gates.

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS - AP2 Protocol Flow Explanations are external protocol requirements (not implementation choices). These define what constitutes valid behavior per external specification, which is appropriate for spec phase.

## Validation Result

**Status**: ✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

The specification is complete, unambiguous, testable, and ready for the planning phase.

## Notes

- **AP2 Protocol Explanations**: These sections describe external protocol requirements from https://ap2-protocol.org/specification/ that define valid system behavior. They are not implementation details but rather constraints imposed by the external standard we must comply with. This is appropriate and necessary for specification completeness.

- **Reusability Requirement**: The Payment Agent reusability requirement (FR-034 through FR-040) is well-defined with testable criteria and is a core business objective of the demo.

- **Mock Services**: The requirement to mock all services (FR-052 through FR-060) is appropriately specified with details on what must be mocked and realistic behavior expectations.

- **Quality Metrics**: Success criteria include both performance metrics (time, throughput) and quality metrics (error message understandability tested with non-developers).

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Or use `/speckit.clarify` if additional requirements emerge during planning
