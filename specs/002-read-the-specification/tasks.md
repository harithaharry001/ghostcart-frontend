---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Human-Not-Present Autonomous Monitoring (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Setup autonomous monitoring with constraints, background job checks conditions, autonomous purchase when met, user notification

**Independent Test**: User sets monitoring request with price/delivery constraints, signs Intent pre-authorization, monitoring job runs in background, conditions met triggers autonomous purchase without user interaction, notification displays with mandate chain showing Intent (user signed), Cart (agent signed with Intent reference), Payment (HNP flag set)

- [X] T060 [US2] Update Home page in `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`: integrate MonitoringStatusCard (displayed when monitoring active), integrate NotificationBanner (displayed when autonomous purchase completes), handle HNP flow orchestration based on SSE events (monitoring setup, background checks, autonomous purchase)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 (HNP flow) is fully functional - monitoring setup with Intent signature, background jobs run and persist across restarts, autonomous purchase when conditions met, notifications work

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Intelligent Agent Routing (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Supervisor agent uses LLM reasoning to route user messages to appropriate specialist agent (HP Shopping or HNP Delegate) based on linguistic analysis, asks clarifying questions for ambiguous requests

**Independent Test**: Send various phrasings of immediate purchase intents (present tense, no conditionals) and verify routing to HP Shopping Agent, send monitoring intents (future action, conditional logic) and verify routing to HNP Delegate Agent, send ambiguous requests and verify clarifying questions before routing

### Backend Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T061 [US3] Create Supervisor Agent in `backend/src/agents/supervisor_strands.py`: Strands Agent with Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Bedrock, system prompt emphasizing linguistic analysis for intent detection (immediate vs monitoring vs ambiguous), tools for routing to HP Shopping Agent and HNP Delegate Agent, clarifying question generation for ambiguous requests - **COMPLETED: Implemented with Strands SDK agents-as-tools pattern, HP and HNP agents wrapped as @tool decorated functions**
- [X] T062 [US3] Update chat endpoint in `backend/src/api/chat.py`: replace direct agent invocation with Supervisor Agent orchestration, Supervisor analyzes message and routes to specialist (HP Shopping for immediate, HNP Delegate for monitoring), if ambiguous return flow_type="clarification" with clarifying question - **COMPLETED: Supervisor properly invokes specialist agents, flow_type detection from tool calls, SSE events for transparency**
- [X] T063 [US3] Add session management in `backend/src/services/session_service.py`: create_session (generate session_id, store in sessions table), update_session (update last_activity_at, store context_data JSON), get_session (retrieve session for continuity), save conversation history for multi-turn clarifications

### Frontend Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T064 [US3] Update ChatInterface component in `frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.jsx`: handle clarification responses from Supervisor (display options or follow-up questions), display agent routing messages ("Routing to shopping assistant" vs "Routing to monitoring assistant"), maintain conversation history across clarifications

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 (agent routing) is fully functional - Supervisor correctly routes based on linguistic analysis, clarifying questions work for ambiguous requests, no hardcoded keyword matching

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories and demo preparation

- [ ] T065 [P] [Polish] Add structured logging across all services in `backend/src/`: JSON format logs with correlation IDs (session_id, transaction_id), separate loggers (mandate_ops, signature_ops, payment_ops, scheduler_ops, errors), log levels per config
- [ ] T066 [P] [Polish] Add error handling polish in `backend/src/main.py`: FastAPI exception handlers map AP2 errors to ErrorResponse schema, log all errors with stack traces, return user-friendly error messages
- [ ] T067 [P] [Polish] Create Payment Agent README in `backend/src/agents/payment_agent/README.md`: document isolation strategy, import restrictions, extraction instructions, reusability demonstration for judges
- [ ] T068 [Polish] Add demo mode accelerated monitoring in `backend/src/services/scheduler.py`: when DEMO_MODE=true use 30-second intervals instead of 5 minutes, document in quickstart.md
- [ ] T069 [P] [Polish] Frontend error handling in `frontend/src/components/`: display user-friendly error messages from API, retry buttons for transient errors, handle SSE connection drops with automatic reconnection
- [ ] T070 [P] [Polish] Frontend performance optimization: lazy load MandateChainViz component, optimize SSE event handling to prevent unnecessary re-renders, add loading states during API calls
- [ ] T071 [Polish] Create demo data seed script in `backend/src/db/seed_demo_data.py`: pre-populate products including spec examples (Coffee Maker $69, AirPods $250), demo user with payment methods, test both success and decline payment scenarios
- [ ] T072 [Polish] Validation against quickstart.md in `specs/002-read-the-specification/quickstart.md`: verify setup instructions work, test HP flow completion <90s (SC-001), test HNP setup <60s (SC-002), verify agent messages stream <500ms (SC-003), verify monitoring checks <2s (SC-004), verify 10 concurrent jobs work (SC-005), verify complete demo <3min (SC-006)
- [ ] T073 [P] [Polish] Payment Agent reusability validation: copy `backend/src/agents/payment_agent/` to test project, verify zero GhostCart imports, confirm it works with different commerce scenario (SC-007)
- [ ] T074 [P] [Polish] AP2 schema compliance validation: contract tests validating IntentMandate, CartMandate, PaymentMandate match official AP2 JSON schemas with 100% field compliance (SC-008)
- [ ] T075 [Polish] Server restart persistence test: start monitoring job, restart backend server, verify job resumes and completes purchase (SC-009)
- [ ] T076 [P] [Polish] Frontend polish: add 1-second fingerprint scanning animation (SC-014), verify mandate chain loads <1s (SC-010), test error messages with 3 non-dev users (SC-011)
- [ ] T077 [Polish] Demo preparation: practice HP flow (target <90s), practice HNP flow setup (target <60s), prepare failure scenarios (payment decline, out of stock, expired mandate), verify Payment Agent extraction demo, rehearse complete demo (both flows + mandate chain viz, target <3min)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion (can run in parallel with US1 with separate team)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion + User Story 1 and 2 agents (Supervisor needs specialists to route to)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories - MVP!
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but integrates Payment Agent from US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Requires US1 and US2 specialist agents to exist for routing

### Within Each User Story

- Backend tasks generally before frontend (models/services before UI)
- Payment Agent isolation (T025-T029) before HP Shopping Agent (T030)
- Services before endpoints
- Frontend Context providers before components that use them
- Core components before page integration

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 Setup**: T001, T002 (different directories), T005-T008 (different files)

**Phase 2 Foundational**: T011-T015 (Pydantic models), T018-T020 (mock services), T023-T024 (SSE) can all run in parallel

**User Story 1 Backend**: T025-T027 (Payment Agent), T030 (HP Shopping Agent), T031-T032 (services), T033-T036 (endpoints) have some parallelization opportunities for different files

**User Story 1 Frontend**: T038-T040 (contexts), T042-T043 (components) can run in parallel

**User Story 2**: T048-T049 can run in parallel with T056-T057 (backend vs frontend)

**Polish**: Many tasks (T065-T067, T069-T070, T073-T074, T076) are independent and can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all Pydantic models together:
Task T011: "Create Pydantic SignatureObject model"
Task T012: "Create Pydantic IntentMandate model"
Task T013: "Create Pydantic CartMandate model"
Task T014: "Create Pydantic PaymentMandate model"
Task T015: "Create Pydantic Transaction model"

# Launch all mock services together:
Task T018: "Create mock Merchant API"
Task T019: "Create mock Credentials Provider"
Task T020: "Create mock Payment Processor"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T008)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T009-T024) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T025-T047)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test HP flow end-to-end (search ‚Üí cart ‚Üí signature ‚Üí payment ‚Üí mandate chain)
5. Demo ready with core purchase flow

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T024)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo MVP! (T025-T047)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo with autonomous monitoring (T048-T060)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo with intelligent routing (T061-T064)
5. Polish ‚Üí Final demo preparation (T065-T077)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completes:

**Team allocation**:
- Developer A: User Story 1 Backend (T025-T037)
- Developer B: User Story 1 Frontend (T038-T047)
- Developer C: User Story 2 (T048-T060) - starts after T025-T029 complete (needs Payment Agent)
- Developer D: Polish tasks (can start anytime)

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 77 tasks
- Phase 1 Setup: 8 tasks
- Phase 2 Foundational: 16 tasks (BLOCKING)
- Phase 3 User Story 1 (P1): 23 tasks (MVP)
- Phase 4 User Story 2 (P2): 13 tasks
- Phase 5 User Story 3 (P3): 4 tasks
- Phase 6 Polish: 13 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: ~30 tasks marked [P] can run concurrently with other tasks

**MVP Scope** (Minimum for hackathon demo):
- Phases 1-3 (T001-T047): Setup + Foundational + User Story 1
- Result: Working HP purchase flow with mandate chain visualization
- Time estimate: 3-4 days for backend + 2 days for frontend = 5-6 days

**Full Feature Scope**:
- All phases (T001-T077): Complete GhostCart with HP, HNP, routing, polish
- Time estimate: 6-9 days per plan.md

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within same phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Payment Agent isolation (T025-T029) is CRITICAL for Constitution Principle II
- Tests are not explicitly included per spec - validation happens via quickstart.md scenarios
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Focus: MVP first (User Story 1), then incremental delivery of User Stories 2 and 3
